<p>First, <span>solve the problem</span>. Then, write the code.</p>
<p>Any fool can <span>write code</span> that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand</p>
<p>Programming can be fun</span>, so can cryptography; however they should not be combined.</p>
<p>Computers are good at following <span>instructions</span>, but not at reading your mind.</p>
<p>Coding, <span>is an ART</span>. Are you an artist?</p>
<p>Before software can be <span>reusable</span> it first has to be usable.</p>
<p><span>Any code</span> of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by <span>someone else</span>.</p>
<p>Software <span>sucks</span> because users demand it to.</p>
