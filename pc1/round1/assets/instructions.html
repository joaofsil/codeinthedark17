--- The rules ---
1) No previews - of either results or assets!
2) Stay in this editor at all times
3) No measurement tools
4) Stop coding when the time's up
5) Use the "Download file" button and save the file as design.html in the same folder as the editor.

Good luck and most important of all; have fun!

I wish &lt;span&gt;I knew&lt;/span&gt; what I am doing.
&lt;span&gt;OLX&lt;/span&gt; code in the dark rocks, &lt;span&gt;OLX&lt;/span&gt; code in the dark rocks &lt;span&gt;OLX&lt;/span&gt; code in the dark rocks
First, &lt;span&gt;solve the problem&lt;/span&gt;. Then, write the code.
Any fool can &lt;span&gt;write code&lt;/span&gt; that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand
Programming can be fun&lt;/span&gt;, so can cryptography; however they should not be combined.
Computers are good at following &lt;span&gt;instructions&lt;/span&gt;, but not at reading your mind.
Coding, &lt;span&gt;is an ART&lt;/span&gt;. Are you an artist?
Before software can be &lt;span&gt;reusable&lt;/span&gt; it first has to be usable.
&lt;span&gt;Any code&lt;/span&gt; of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by &lt;span&gt;someone else&lt;/span&gt;.
Software &lt;span&gt;sucks&lt;/span&gt; because users demand it to.
